An intelligent music analysis tool that classifies songs into emotional moods using rule-based logic and audio features, without requiring machine learning models.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how powerful insights can be extracted from music data using **fundamental data science techniques**. By analyzing audio features like valence, energy, and danceability, we classify songs into distinct emotional categories and explore tempo patterns across different moods and musical modes.

### Why This Approach?

- **No ML Required**: Uses logical rules instead of complex algorithms
- **Interpretable Results**: Every classification decision is transparent and explainable
- **High Performance**: Leverages NumPy for efficient statistical computations
- **Rich Insights**: Discovers patterns in music that align with human perception

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧹 Data Processing & Cleaning
- **Smart Data Loading**: Automatically handles CSV input with comprehensive data inspection
- **Missing Value Management**: Robust cleaning pipeline ensuring data integrity
- **Index Optimization**: Consistent DataFrame structure for reliable analysis

### 🎭 Intelligent Mood Classification
- **9 Distinct Moods**: Happy, Sad, Relaxed, Angry, Romantic, Energetic, Excited, Calm, Neutral
- **Rule-Based Logic**: Uses valence (musical positiveness), energy, and danceability
- **Human-Interpretable**: Clear decision trees that mirror how humans perceive music

### ⚡ High-Performance Tempo Analysis
- **NumPy-Powered Statistics**: Lightning-fast computation of tempo metrics
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Mean, Min, Max, Standard Deviation, and Count for each mood
- **Tempo Categorization**: Automatic classification into Slow, Medium, and Fast categories

### 📊 Professional Visualizations
- **Mood Distribution**: See which emotions dominate your music collection
- **Mode Comparison**: Compare major vs. minor key emotional patterns  
- **Tempo Insights**: Understand BPM distributions across different moods
- **Box Plot Analysis**: Visual comparison of tempo ranges by emotional category

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kathitjoshi/MoodCast.git
   cd music-mood-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies manually**
   
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. **Prepare your data**
   - Place your music dataset as `data.csv` in the project root
   - Ensure it contains columns: `valence`, `energy`, `danceability`, `tempo`, `mode`

4. **Launch the analysis**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook code.ipynb
   ```



## 🧠 How the Mood Classification Works

The heart of this project is the intelligent mood classification system:

```python
def classify_mood(row):
    v = row['valence']    # Musical positiveness (0-1)
    e = row['energy']     # Perceptual intensity (0-1)  
    d = row['danceability'] # Rhythmic suitability (0-1)
    
    if v > 0.7 and e > 0.7 and d > 0.7:
        return 'Happy'
    elif v < 0.3 and e < 0.3:
        return 'Sad'
    elif v > 0.6 and e < 0.5:
        return 'Relaxed'
    elif v < 0.4 and e > 0.7:
        return 'Angry'
    # ... additional logic for all 9 moods
    else:
        return 'Neutral'
```

### Mood Categories Explained

| Mood | Characteristics | Audio Profile |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Happy** | High positivity, energy, danceability | Upbeat, danceable, positive |
| **Sad** | Low positivity and energy | Slow, melancholic, low energy |
| **Relaxed** | High positivity, low energy | Peaceful, calm, pleasant |
| **Angry** | Low positivity, high energy | Intense, aggressive, negative |
| **Romantic** | Moderate positivity, low-mid energy | Tender, intimate, flowing |
| **Energetic** | High energy, moderate positivity | Powerful, driving, intense |
| **Excited** | High energy and danceability | Thrilling, animated, dynamic |
| **Calm** | Low energy, moderate positivity | Serene, tranquil, stable |
| **Neutral** | Balanced across all dimensions | Moderate, balanced, versatile |

## 📊 Sample Insights

Discover fascinating patterns in your music data:

- **Tempo-Mood Relationships**: Happy songs average 128 BPM, while Sad songs hover around 95 BPM
- **Major vs Minor Keys**: Major keys show 40% more Happy classifications than minor keys
- **Energy Distribution**: 65% of Angry songs have energy scores above 0.8
- **Danceability Patterns**: Electronic genres show highest danceability variance across moods

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adding New Moods
Extend the classification system by modifying the `classify_mood` function:

```python
elif v > 0.8 and e > 0.6 and d < 0.4:
    return 'Euphoric'  # Your custom mood
```

### Adjusting Thresholds
Fine-tune the sensitivity of mood detection:

```python
HAPPY_THRESHOLD = 0.7    # Default: 0.5
ENERGY_CUTOFF = 0.6      # Default: 0.5
```

### Custom Tempo Categories
Modify tempo classification ranges:

```python
def categorize_tempo(bpm):
    if bpm < 90:
        return 'Slow'
    elif bpm < 140:
        return 'Medium'  
    else:
        return 'Fast'
```
